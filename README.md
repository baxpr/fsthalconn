Given preprocessed fMRI data from https://github.com/baxpr/connprep and regions of interest from https://github.com/baxpr/freesurfer-singularity, generate seed connectivity maps and matrices for particular thalamocortical ROI sets.

ROIs are defined from freesurfer segmentations as described in the file `src/rois/CombinedFreesurferLabels_reorg.csv`.
